Tried opening up DHbox, and realized I forgot to turn on my VPN, silly me. 
Opened the databases, started with EDH. 
No clue what to search up, not sure what HD number is. 
found it funny that the simple search had so many requirements/sections to narrow down search. 
Clicked on advanced search and did not even know where to begin. 
Went on the CWGC, searched my surname, without putting information for anything else. 
Turned up with no results, could be because I am from Singapore, and there were many changes to the surname over generations. 
Tried the last name of my brother in law, and narrowed down to New Zealand. 5 results
