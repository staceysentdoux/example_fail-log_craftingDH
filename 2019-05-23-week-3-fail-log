Tried opening up DHbox, and realized I forgot to turn on my VPN, silly me. 
Opened the databases, started with EDH. 
No clue what to search up, not sure what HD number is. 
found it funny that the simple search had so many requirements/sections to narrow down search. 
Clicked on advanced search and did not even know where to begin. 
Went on the CWGC, searched my surname, without putting information for anything else. 
Turned up with no results, could be because I am from Singapore, and there were many changes to the surname over generations. 
Tried the last name of my brother in law, and narrowed down to New Zealand. 5 results

copied all the links into nano on DHbox, 
saved it
added to repository

onto exercise 2, and my brain is already starting to go to mush. 
with my concussion, I have to be aware of how much looking at the codes etc on the screen will affect my migraines. 
waiting for wget to download all the papers from Miligan's guide. 
decided to take a break as I felt a migraine coming on. 
Came back and tried again. 
Since the VPN disconnected while I was AFK, had to re-log-in on DH box. 
Not sure if history saved properly. Tried to upload it to Diilinger and then on GitHub. 

Attempted exercise 2 again. Kurschinki's tutorial made me so confused as I tried putting the code in DH box and it said command not found. 
Then I tried to do it on Dillinger and could not save it as a Python file. 
I am not sure what I am doing wrong, lots of trial and error and my brain has had enough for the week. 
I definitely did push myself this week and even tried to spread it out by doing the reading exercises yesterday. 

I feel defeated this week, but that will not prevent me from succeeding next week. Some deep breaths. 

Perhaps I will try again when I am back from Toronto on Sunday.
