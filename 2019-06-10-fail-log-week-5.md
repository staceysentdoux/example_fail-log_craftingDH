did not want to install on laptop as don't have storage space on disk. so did exercise 9 first. 

was cool to see it do math so easily! even algebra too! Wish I had this tool in high school! 

downloading igraph on rstudio
taking a real long time. 
said object nodes not found. hmm why. 
keeps saying no such file in directory. 
still not working. not sure what is going on. 
reached out on slack, going to do exercise 10 next. 
QGIS won't download and chrome kept crashing. 
Feeling extremely frustrated at the moment. 
Going to try 3 more times and then I think I may have to call it a day before I lose it. 
Still. Not. Working. ARRGGHHH
