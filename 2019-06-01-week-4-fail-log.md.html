<ul>
<li>in the beginning of the regex exercise, was a bit lost as was unable to get to exercise 4 in the last module.</li>
</ul>
<p>thought I was putting the curl command in regex, did not realize it was in dhbox.<br>
silly me<br>
opened texas.txt on nano.<br>
super confused with all the codes.<br>
trying to cut text on nano. not sure where the index is, and what to cut or uncut.<br>
managed to find the letters, took a while. saved file in nano, after cutting those letters.<br>
managed to play around and arrange the data by sender receiver and date.<br>
took me a while. kept forgetting to leave out the $ when copying the commands in.</p>
<p>could not open refine. not sure if it a Mac issue. said it ““OpenRefine” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.”<br>
tried to change my preferences in app store/applications and could not edit it.</p>
