# Week 1 fail log
I did have quite the difficulty this week. I have 3 take home finals that were deferred due to a family death, hence it has been quite the struggle to juggle moving cities, the take home exams and a new summer course. While I am not quite a technical person to begin with, I have taken a games studies class in COMS, where I learnt to create a game on Twine. I ended up getting an A on the project which raised my confidence in the tech side of things. I hope this course will help me to be more comfortable and confident when dealing with tech.
